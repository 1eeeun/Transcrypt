The main module is inline in the global function.
It is preceded by the inline of __builtin__ so it can use that.
It copies its globals to all, like any module.
But it doesn't have to return all, the global function does that.
It's also not a function, the global function is the function.

NO!
This would make it's globals visible from all the other modules!!
So it should be an ordinary module.
But its globals should be added to the all of the global function.
