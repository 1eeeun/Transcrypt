It should be possible to precompile modules.
To compile a module, the compiled code of all imported modules has to be available.
This is also how the CPython interpreter works.

The transpiler must be able to lift module information from a compiled module.
To do this:
	Search backward through a compiled module to find the word 'return'
	Then replace all punctuation by blanks
	Then split into a list
	Then make a set of it to remove dupplicates
	Then sort the set
